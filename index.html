						Born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Breonna Nicole July has used the adversities that she has undergone in her twenty years
						as a stepping stool in life. As an adolescent, Breonna did not have a stable relationship with either of her biological
						parents due to her mother battling a drug addiction and not knowing the identity of her biological father. As a result, she,
						along with her two brothers, were adopted at birth by their grandparents, Meme and PawPaw. Thanks to the
						love and support provided by her grandparents, Breonna was able to grow up in a fulfilling environment that taught her valuable
						morals and life values.

						<br> <br>

						One of the many lessons that her grandparents taught her was how much it pays to be nice to people. She learned that everyone
						you come across is fighting a battle that you know nothing about. Breonna makes it her mission to be personable,
						selfless, and kind-hearted to those she comes in contact with. She wants people to realize that regardless of whatever is
						happening in your life, with determination, your level of ambition,and humility you can persevere in life.
						It is not about where you've been, but where you are going.

						<br> <br>

						Due to her MeMe being a typing teacher, technology was brought to her attention on a constant basis. The amount of
						time it took her Meme to type one sentence onto the computer using the keyboard fascinated Breonna. In addition, she
						remembers her older brother being in high school and being able to fix the simplest issues with the computer
						whether it be the internet connection, a simple plug not being plugged in all the way, or printer connectivity.
						She said to herself, "I have to learn how to do all of that and more!" She has always been a curious little girl who
						wanted to know more about technology because it is a field that is growing daily with a variety of options or
						career paths that she may be able to pursue.

						<br> <br>

						Breonna graduted from Spelman College in 2018 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
						Upon graduating from Spelman, Breonna has accepted a full-time role with Microsft in Dallas, Texas.
						Because technology is constantly growing, it is in dire need of more African American men and women.
						As a leader both inside and outside of the classroom, Breonna plans to use her degree to inspire and
						motivate the young men and women of her community. As of now, she is in the
						process of developing an idea that will enhance people of color at both HBCUs and PWIs. Stay tuned!

						declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
